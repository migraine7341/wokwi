## How it works

7 consecutive xnor gates linking with the previous one + number input

## How to test

read above and figure it out

| previous gate xnor current number | output xnor |
|-----------------------------------|-------------|
| 0 0                               | 1           |
| 1 0                               | 0           |
| 0 1                               | 0           |
| 1 1                               | 1           |

multiple outputs will produced varying displays
